						<h2>Curator Lyssandra Valeheart</h2>
						<small>Synthesizer - Interpreter of the Lost Ages</small>
						<h3>Professional Bio</h3>
						<p>Curator Lyssandra Valeheart is the narrative heart of the Hall of Fantasy, weaving together discoveries from across its many departments into coherent histories. Formerly the Royal Archivist of Eldenmarch, she now applies her mastery of runic translation and historical interpretation to curate the museum's major exhibitions. Lyssandra's work transforms isolated relics into living stories—connecting Garric's field excavations and Elowen's celestial studies into a broader cultural context. Her exhibitions are renowned for their emotional resonance, often pairing ancient artifacts with recorded oral histories and restored inscriptions. A quiet scholar with a deep reverence for truth, she believes every object holds not just knowledge, but memory. Visitors often leave her galleries with the feeling that history itself has spoken to them.</p>

						<h3>Muesum Role</h3>
						<p>Lyssandra curates the Hall's major exhibits, weaving together findings from Garric's excavations and Elowen's Titan studies into cohesive narratives for the public. She designs the interpretive displays, writes the historical texts, and ensures each artifact's story is told with authenticity and emotion. Her role is the connective thread between discovery, interpretation, and presentation—turning research into experience.</p>

						<h3>Historian AND Mage</h3>
						<p>Once a court historian under a human monarchy, Lyssandra carries a deep skepticism toward institutional narratives of power and empire. Her curation often centers voices excluded from traditional chronicles—kobold artisans, dwarven miners, and forgotten human scribes—presenting history as a tapestry of collaboration rather than conquest. She has quietly pushed for the repatriation of several key artifacts to their ancestral halls, a stance that has drawn both admiration and criticism within the Hall. Lyssandra views the museum not as a vault of ownership, but as a living dialogue between past and present, memory and myth.</p>

						<h2>Magister Elowen Starbloom</h2>
						<small>Anthropologist - Scholar of the Titans</small>
						<h3>Professional Bio</h3>
						<p>Magister Elowen Starbloom serves as the Hall's foremost authority on the anthropology of the Titans and the early civilizations shaped by their influence. Educated at the Astral Conservatory of Sylvaenor, she has dedicated her research to decoding the interplay between mortal evolution and divine creation. Her studies bridge science and myth, blending meticulous artifact analysis with arcane resonance testing to trace the lingering energies of Titan-forged relics. Elowen's calm intellect and unwavering curiosity have earned her respect among scholars and mages alike. She is known to spend long evenings in the museum's Arcane Vaults, observing relics as they hum faintly with long-forgotten power. Her lectures inspire visitors to see the Titans not merely as gods, but as ancient architects whose influence still shapes the world today.</p>

						<h3>Muesum Role</h3>
						<p>Elowen leads the museum's research division dedicated to Titan anthropology and the study of celestial civilizations. She curates the Arcane Vaults, a collection of magically resonant artifacts, and conducts ongoing research into the arcane signatures that link them. Her team analyzes relics recovered by field expeditions, deciphering their purpose and tracing the influence of divine creation across mortal history.</p>

						<h3>Touched by the Titans</h3>
						<p>Elowen's work often questions the authority of mortal institutions to interpret divine relics, particularly those of the Titans. She challenges the museum's reliance on linear, anthropocentric histories, advocating for a more spiritual and ecological understanding of creation. Her belief that Titan relics possess living memory has led to debates with more pragmatic scholars about the boundary between science and reverence. Elowen's elven lineage also informs her critique of human-dominated academia, urging the Hall to embrace multi-racial and interplanar perspectives in its exhibitions.</p>

						<h2>Master Garric Stonehelm</h2>
						<small>Archaeologist - Warden of Unearthed Histories</small>
						<h3>Professional Bio</h3>
						<p>Master Garric Stonehelm has spent over four decades unearthing the relics that define the Hall's most celebrated collections. Born in the mining strongholds of Ironmantle Keep, Garric's early years were shaped by the clang of forges and the echoes of ancient tunnels. His skill in identifying structural integrity within crumbling ruins has saved countless expeditions from collapse. As Chief Relic Excavator, he oversees the recovery and restoration of artifacts from dwarven and kobold ruins alike, ensuring their preservation for scholarly study. Garric's signature restoration methods—combining traditional dwarven forging with rune-etched stabilization—are now standard practice among field teams. Known for his booming laugh and steady leadership, he embodies the enduring craftsmanship and curiosity that define the dwarven spirit.</p>

						<h3>Muesum Role</h3>
						<p>Garric oversees all field expeditions for the Hall of Fantasy, directing excavation teams as they unearth ancient ruins and long-buried relics. When not in the field, he supervises restoration work in the museum's lower workshops, ensuring every artifact is handled with the same precision as the day it was forged. His work bridges the excavation site and the exhibition floor, transforming raw discovery into preserved history.</p>

						<h3>Dwarven Champion</h3>
						<p>Garric's dwarven heritage shapes his strong views on the ethics of excavation and ownership. He has publicly opposed the “claim-by-excavation” policies long favored by imperial scholars, arguing that relics should remain close to their cultural origins whenever possible. This stance has occasionally placed him at odds with Agent A researchers who prioritize artifact acquisition over preservation ethics. His insistence on community consultation—especially with kobold clans whose tunnels he studies—has reframed excavation as a shared act of stewardship rather than conquest.</p>
