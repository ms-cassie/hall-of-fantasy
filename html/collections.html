					<h3>Everburning Candle Reliquary</h3>
					<div class="collection-item-data-points">
						<p><span class="data-point">Material: </span>Hardened beeswax residue, bronze base, volcanic stone pedestal.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Size/Weight/Shape: </span>32 cm tall, 12 cm wide; 3.4 kg; twin-candle structure set into a carved kobold effigy base.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Estimated Age: </span>Approximately 1,900 years; dating inferred from mineral accretion on the wax and tool marks consistent with early kobold metallurgy.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Preservation State: </span>Partial; wax fossilized and fused with base, wicks intact but fragile. Flame still glowing.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Location Found: </span>Embercrag Catacombs, Chamber of Hollow Flame (Depth Level 3).</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Likely Purpose: </span>Ritual illumination tool used in forge-blessing ceremonies and funerary rites honoring the kobold fire deity, Zurn the Kindled.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Evidence of Use: </span>Char residue around wicks, soot buildup within the effigy's eye sockets, faint scent of burned honey wax.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Manufacture Clues: </span>Bronze casting seams beneath wax buildup, runic carving on pedestal translated as "Light Guides the Burrow".</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Found With: </span>Fragmented clay idols, ash-laden offering bowls, melted coins of unknown minting.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Burial or Habitat Context: </span>Interred in ceremonial alcove near a collapsed ventilation shaft, likely sealed after a catastrophic fire event.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Symbolism: </span>Represents kobold belief that flame embodies both spirit and memory; the candlelight was thought to guide the souls of miners to eternal warmth.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Comparison: </span>Comparable to dwarven “Lanterns of Mourning,” though kobold versions exhibit more organic sculpting and wax layering, symbolizing impermanence rather than endurance.</p>

					<h3>Helm of the Worldbreaker</h3>
					<div class="collection-item-data-points">
						<p><span class="data-point">Material: </span>Celestial gold, obsidian core, and trace elements of unknown star-forged alloys.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Size/Weight/Shape: </span>1.2 meters in height, 0.9 meters in width; weighs approximately 720 kg; shaped as a full-faced helm with spiked crown ridges.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Estimated Age: </span>37,000 ±500 years; inferred through Titan Epoch strata alignment and aetheric resonance decay readings.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Preservation State: </span>Pristine; impervious to oxidation, corrosion, and elemental interference due to residual Titan enchantments.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Location Found: </span>Unearthed in the Ruins of Askarion, beneath a collapsed celestial vault at 12°N, 67°E; discovered sealed within a containment monolith.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Likely Purpose: </span>Ceremonial and martial artifact of the First Titans, believed to grant the wearer near-divine dominion over elemental forces and astral energies.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Evidence of Use: </span>Minor scoring across the helm's lower rim indicative of high-impact force; faint energy burns suggest previous activation of power conduits.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Manufacture Clues: </span>Crafted through lost celestial forgemastery, utilizing metallurgical processes that fused material essence and divine will; runes etched with stellar precision.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Found With: </span>Fragments of broken armor plating, residual crystallized mana cores, and two petrified servitor constructs.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Burial or Habitat Context: </span>Encased in an aetheric stasis field within the Titan vault; suggests deliberate isolation following the Sundering Wars.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Symbolism: </span>Represents the Titans' paradox of creation and destruction—both world-shapers and annihilators; the helm's design mirrors the duality of genesis and ruin.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Comparison: </span>Similar in mythic stature to the “Crown of the Dawnforger,” though vastly more potent; only the Helm of the Worldbreaker exhibits confirmed residual cosmic energy fields detectable through containment wards.</p>

					<h3>Fossilized Remains of the Prime Kobold</h3>
					<div class="collection-item-data-points">
						<p><span class="data-point">Material: </span>Petrified skeletal remains, basaltic mineral deposits, and fused crystalized bone fragments.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Size/Weight/Shape: </span>Approx. 1.8 meters tall in reconstructed form; estimated weight 340 kg; humanoid draconic frame with elongated claws and a ridged tail spine.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Estimated Age: </span>14,000 ±250 years; determined through sedimentary layering and residual mana decay dating.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Preservation State: </span>Partial; ~60% of skeletal structure intact; right leg, ribcage, and tail tip melted or crystallized by magical exposure.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Location Found: </span>The Obsidian Hollows, southern edge of Emberfall Range, 43°N, 9°E; uncovered during a mana-reactive fault collapse.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Likely Purpose: </span>Biological specimen; believed to represent an apex evolutionary stage of early kobold species, bred for subterranean endurance and martial strength.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Evidence of Use: </span>Deep scoring on bone claws suggests tool handling or combat use; tooth wear consistent with omnivorous diet.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Manufacture Clues: </span>N/A — natural fossil remains; however, fusion seams between melted bones indicate exposure to directed aetheric heat rather than geological lava.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Found With: </span>Fragments of bronze mining tools, fossilized torch resin, and scattered ritual charms of bone and ash.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Burial or Habitat Context: </span>Found in collapsed cavern network, presumed to have been a living den converted to a tomb during a catastrophic magical anomaly.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Symbolism: </span>Considered sacred among modern kobolds—believed to embody the lost lineage of “The Emberborn,” who first brought flame and craft to the deep world.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Comparison: </span>Distinctly bulkier and denser than modern kobolds; bone density closer to dwarves; fused claw structures unique among known kobold variants.</p>

					<h3>The Radiant Remains of Elarion, First of the Elves</h3>
					<div class="collection-item-data-points">
						<p><span class="data-point">Material: </span>Fossilized bone infused with residual arcane essence; faint crystalline deposits along marrow channels.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Size/Weight/Shape: </span>2.1 meters in height when assembled; estimated weight 110 kg; slender humanoid skeletal structure with elongated limbs and high cranial ridge typical of proto-elven morphology.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Estimated Age: </span>4,200 ±50 years; verified through temporal resonance mapping and ley-line interference readings.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Preservation State: </span>Exceptional; 85% of skeletal structure intact, suspended in stasis within an arcane containment field to prevent energy decay.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Location Found: </span>The Vale of Echoing Light, beneath the ruins of Alen'shyr, 39°N, 22°E; discovered sealed within an ancient ritual sarcophagus.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Likely Purpose: </span>Biological remains; presumed to be that of Elarion the First, a mythic progenitor figure believed to have communed directly with the life-stream of the world.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Evidence of Use: </span>Residual aura signature suggests post-mortem energy fluctuations consistent with ritual channeling or soul-binding at death.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Manufacture Clues: </span>N/A — natural specimen; however, the pattern of magical crystallization along bone ridges suggests deliberate preservation through high-order elven enchantment.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Found With: </span>Fragments of ceremonial jewelry, a sunstone diadem, and shattered remnants of a silver ritual mirror.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Burial or Habitat Context: </span>Entombed within a sanctified chamber designed for ley alignment, indicating worship or posthumous reverence rather than mere burial.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Symbolism: </span>Represents the dawn of elven civilization and the direct link between flesh and magic; the faint glow that emanates from the remains is said to be the lingering spark of Elario's soul.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Comparison: </span>The only known proto-elven fossil to exhibit measurable magical radiation; comparable only to the half-preserved bones of the “Singers of Thalassir,” though far more stable and radiant.</p>

					<h3>The Containment Chamber of the Voidbound Demon</h3>
					<div class="collection-item-data-points">
						<p><span class="data-point">Material: </span>Reinforced voidsteel, black crystal panels, and enchanted silver filigree; core powered by soul-binding glyphs and perpetual energy runes.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Size/Weight/Shape: </span>2.5 meters tall, cube-shaped containment chamber; estimated mass 2.3 metric tons; adorned with glowing ward-chains that cross the chamber in six directions.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Estimated Age: </span>9,100 ±400 years; dated to the Shadow Wars Era through comparative analysis of residual mana frequencies in binding sigils.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Preservation State: </span>Active containment—stasis intact but monitored continuously; internal energy fluctuations recorded during celestial alignments.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Location Found: </span>Subterranean vault beneath the ruins of the Blackspire Monastery, 19°S, 15°E; discovered during an excavation led by Magister Elowen Starbloom's expedition team.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Likely Purpose: </span>Designed to imprison a Voidbound Demon—an ancient, pre-mortal entity composed of shadow and entropy. The chamber simultaneously drains and recycles its power to sustain the prison's stability.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Evidence of Use: </span>Scorched interior surfaces and warped metal from previous containment breaches; deep gouges along crystal panels attributed to attempts at escape prior to full stasis induction.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Manufacture Clues: </span>Constructed via a hybrid of Titan forgemastery and Obsidian Order sorcery—suggesting cooperation between early divine and mortal magi; the blue ward-light corresponds to celestial siphon runes used for void suppression.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Found With: </span>Collapsed containment pylons, fragments of protective seals, and the remains of five bound wardens whose souls appear to be integrated into the cube's outer wards.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Burial or Habitat Context: </span>Vaulted crypt lined with anti-teleportation wards and nullstone barriers; evidence indicates centuries of monitoring even after the chamber was sealed.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Symbolism: </span>Represents the eternal vigilance of civilization against the darkness that predates creation; known colloquially among scholars as “The Sleeping Sin”.</p>
						<p><span class="data-point">Comparison: </span>Shares energy patterns with lesser shadow reliquaries found across the southern Obsidian Range, but this chamber's depth of stasis runes and layered containment arrays mark it as a singular artifact of its kind.</p>
